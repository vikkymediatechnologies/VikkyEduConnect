            <p className="mb-4">
              EduConnect was born from a simple observation: while technology was transforming every aspect of life, Nigerian education remained largely traditional. Our founder, Victor, witnessed firsthand the challenges students faced accessing quality education, especially in preparing for critical examinations like WAEC, JAMB, and NECO.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Starting as a small tutoring initiative, we quickly realized that the solution wasn't just about teaching â€“ it was about creating a comprehensive ecosystem that serves students, teachers, parents, and schools alike. Today, we're proud to be at the forefront of Nigeria's educational technology revolution.
            </p>
            <p>
              From exam preparation to complete school management systems, we're committed to making quality education accessible, affordable, and effective for everyone in the Nigerian educational community.
